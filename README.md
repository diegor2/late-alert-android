Late alert is an application created for the 2016 internal hackathon for the Software Engineering specialization course from IC/Unicamp.

It's an hybrib application with embedded web interface for creating events on google calendar, which will use the mobile device GPS thru Google Location Services to calculate the distance the user is from the event location. It also uses Google's Distance Matrix service to calculate if the user may be late to meet it's guests and send a email notification for all the people invited to the same event.
